<p>The villa was constructed by relocating and expanding a residence from Edo Castle, incorporating parts that dated back to the early 17th century. The architecture seamlessly blends different periods and styles, from Edo period chambers to Meiji era innovations, creating a unique historical tapestry.</p>

<p>Visitors can explore the imperial living quarters, admire the intricate woodwork and painted sliding doors (fusuma-e), and stroll through the meticulously maintained Japanese gardens. The villa also features rare architectural elements like the suspended ceiling in the main hall and elaborate decorative metalwork.</p>

<p>The villa served as a refuge for the imperial family during World War II and now operates as a memorial park and museum, offering insight into imperial life and Japan's architectural heritage during a crucial period of modernization.</p>
