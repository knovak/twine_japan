</div>

<h2>Route Options</h2>

<p>Two main railway companies operate between Tokyo and Nikko, each with distinct advantages. The <strong>Tobu Railway</strong> offers direct trains from Asakusa Station, while <strong>JR East</strong> provides Shinkansen connections via Utsunomiya.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Tobu Limited Express (Recommended for Speed)</h3>

<p>The fastest and most convenient route departs from <strong>Tobu Asakusa Station</strong> (accessible via Ginza and Asakusa subway lines). Limited Express trains reach Tobu-Nikko Station in approximately 1 hour 50 minutes.</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Limited Express Trains</strong><br>
• <strong>Spacia/Revaty</strong>: Direct service, 1h 50min, ¥3,050<br>
• <strong>Kinu</strong>: Transfer at Shimo-Imaichi, 1h 50min, ¥2,850<br>
• Departures: 1-2 trains per hour starting from 6:30 AM<br>
• Reserved seating required
</div>

<p>For budget travelers, regular express and local trains make the journey in 2 hours 20-30 minutes for only ¥1,400, though they require 1-3 transfers along the way.</p>

<h3>Option 2: JR East via Shinkansen</h3>

<p>Take the <strong>Tohoku Shinkansen</strong> (Yamabiko or Nasuno trains) from Tokyo or Ueno Station to Utsunomiya, then transfer to the JR Nikko Line. Total journey time is approximately 1 hour 40 minutes, but costs ¥5,000-5,500 one way. This option works well if you have a JR Pass.</p>

<h2>Multi-Day Pass Options</h2>

<p>For your 5-day stay (Oct 10-14), consider these money-saving passes:</p>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Nikko All Area Pass</strong> (Recommended)<br>
• <strong>¥8,000</strong> for 4 consecutive days<br>
• Round-trip train from Asakusa to Nikko<br>
• Unlimited buses to Yumoto Onsen, Lake Chuzenji, and throughout Nikko<br>
• Lake Chuzenji sightseeing cruise (mid-April to November)<br>
• Discounts at restaurants and attractions<br>
• <strong>Note:</strong> Limited Express surcharge paid separately (¥1,450-2,140 each way)
</div>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Nikko World Heritage Area Pass</strong><br>
• <strong>¥4,780</strong> for 2 consecutive days (Apr 20-Nov 30)<br>
• Round-trip train from Asakusa<br>
• World Heritage loop bus only<br>
• Good if staying in central Nikko only
</div>

<p>The All Area Pass offers the best value for your itinerary since you'll be traveling to Yumoto Onsen. A single round-trip to Yumoto costs ¥3,900 by bus alone, so the pass pays for itself quickly.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Book Limited Express seats early</strong> for October travel (peak autumn foliage season). Trains fill up quickly on weekends.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid weekends if possible</strong> during autumn, as roads and trains are heavily congested. Your October 10 departure (Friday) should be manageable.</li>
<li><strong>Keep your digital ticket accessible</strong> throughout your journey. You'll need to show it when boarding trains and buses.</li>
<li><strong>Arrive 20 minutes early</strong> at Asakusa Station for your first train to familiarize yourself with the platform layout.</li>
<li><strong>Download the Hyperdia app</strong> for real-time train schedules and platform information during your trip.</li>
