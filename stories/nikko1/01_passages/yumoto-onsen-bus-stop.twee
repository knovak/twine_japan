<p>Regular bus services operate from Nikko Station via Tobu Bus, taking approximately 80 minutes through winding mountain roads with spectacular scenery. The route passes through the famous Irohazaka winding road, Lake Chuzenji, and Kegon Falls before reaching the remote hot spring area.</p>

<p>From this terminal, visitors can access numerous hiking trails, including paths to Yu-no-taki Falls, the source of the Yukawa River, and various marshland areas rich in alpine flora. The area is particularly beautiful during autumn when the surrounding mountains display brilliant fall colors.</p>

<p>The bus stop area includes basic facilities such as restrooms, a small waiting area, and information boards with local hiking maps. During winter months, the area transforms into a snowy wonderland, and the bus terminal serves as the starting point for winter sports activities and snow hiking adventures.</p>

<p>The terminal is surrounded by several traditional ryokan and onsen hotels, making it convenient for visitors to access accommodation while enjoying the therapeutic sulfur springs that have been used for over 1,200 years.</p>
