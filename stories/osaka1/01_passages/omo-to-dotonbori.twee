<h2>Getting to Dotonbori: Step by Step</h2>

<p>Dotonbori, Osaka's most famous entertainment district, is easily accessible from your hotel at the Kansai Airport. The journey involves taking a train from Kansai Airport Station to Namba Station, followed by a short 5-minute walk to the heart of Dotonbori.</p>

<h3>Step 1: From OMO Hotel to Kansai Airport Station</h3>

<p>Your hotel (OMO Kansai Airport by Hoshino Resorts) is located inside the Aeroplaza building, directly connected to Kansai Airport's Terminal 1. To reach the train station:</p>

<ol>
<li>Exit the hotel lobby and follow signs for "Railway Station" or "JR/Nankai"</li>
<li>Take the escalator or elevator down to the 2nd floor of Terminal 1</li>
<li>The station entrance is clearly marked with both JR and Nankai Railway signs</li>
<li>Walk time: 5-7 minutes</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 2: Take the Train to Namba</h3>

<p>You have two excellent train options, both operated by Nankai Electric Railway:</p>

</div>

<h3>Buying Train Tickets (First-Time Visitor Guide)</h3>

<p><strong>At the Station Ticket Machine:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Locate the Nankai Railway ticket machines (separate from JR machines)</li>
<li>Look for the English language button (usually a flag icon)</li>
<li>Select your destination: "Namba" or "Nankai Namba"</li>
<li>Choose ticket type:
   <ul>
   <li>For Rapi:t: Select "Limited Express + Basic Fare Ticket"</li>
   <li>For Airport Express: Select "Basic Fare Only"</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>Insert cash or use credit card</li>
<li>Collect your ticket(s) and change</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Using IC Cards (Suica/PASMO/ICOCA):</strong></p>

<p>If you have an IC card, you can tap in at the ticket gates for the Airport Express (¥970 will be deducted). However, for the Rapi:t limited express, you still need to purchase a limited express ticket at the machine for an additional ¥520.</p>

<p><strong>Helpful Tip:</strong> Station staff at the Nankai ticket counter speak English and can assist with ticket purchases if needed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Finding Your Platform</h3>

<p>After purchasing your ticket, pass through the Nankai ticket gates (clearly marked with orange Nankai signage). Follow signs for your train:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Rapi:t Limited Express:</strong> Usually departs from Platform 2 or 3</li>
<li><strong>Airport Express:</strong> Usually departs from Platform 1 or 2</li>
</ul>

<p>Digital display boards show upcoming departures with train type, departure time, and platform number in both Japanese and English.</p>

<h3>Step 4: From Namba Station to Dotonbori</h3>

<p>When you arrive at Namba Station, follow these simple directions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Exit through the ticket gates (tap IC card or insert ticket)</li>
<li>Look for signs pointing to <strong>"Dotonbori"</strong> or <strong>"Ebisubashi"</strong> (both lead to the same area)</li>
<li>Follow Exit 5 or Exit 14—both work well</li>
<li>Walk south through the covered Namba Walk shopping arcade (optional shortcut)</li>
<li>After about 5 minutes of walking, you'll emerge onto Midosuji Avenue</li>
<li>Cross Midosuji and continue straight toward the Glico Running Man sign</li>
<li>You'll reach the famous Dotonbori canal and Ebisubashi Bridge</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Total walk from Namba Station to Dotonbori:</strong> 5-8 minutes</p>
