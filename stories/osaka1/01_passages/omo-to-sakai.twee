<h3>How to Purchase Tickets (First-Time Visitor Guide)</h3>

<p><strong>Option 1: Ticket Machine (Recommended)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Locate the Nankai Railway ticket machines (orange signage)</li>
<li>Press the English language button</li>
<li>Look at the fare map above the machine to find "Sakai" – the fare is ¥330</li>
<li>Insert ¥330 (or more if using bills—machine gives change)</li>
<li>Collect your ticket</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Option 2: IC Card (ICOCA/Suica/PASMO)</strong></p>

<p>The easiest method if you have an IC card:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simply tap your IC card at the ticket gates when entering</li>
<li>Tap again when exiting at Sakai Station</li>
<li>¥330 will automatically be deducted</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You don't need to worry about Limited Express trains for this short journey. Both the regular Airport Express and Local trains are included in the ¥330 base fare.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Finding Your Platform</h3>

<p>After purchasing your ticket or tapping through with your IC card:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pass through the Nankai ticket gates</li>
<li>Look for signs indicating "Namba" or "Osaka" direction</li>
<li>Go to Platform 1 or 2 (typical platforms for Namba-bound trains)</li>
<li>Check the departure board—both "Airport Express" (空港急行) and "Local" (普通) trains stop at Sakai</li>
<li>Board any train heading toward Namba</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> DO NOT board the Rapi:t Limited Express (it doesn't stop at Sakai and requires an expensive surcharge). Look for regular trains marked "Airport Express" or "Local."</p>

<p>October 4 (Saturday) is a perfect time to visit—the weather will be pleasant autumn temperatures (around 20-24°C), and you'll avoid the festival crowds that arrive two weeks later.</p>
