<p>Here’s a super-handy Japan travel trick you’ll love: forward (ship) your luggage so you can ride trains and bounce between cities with only a small daypack.</p>

<h2>What it’s called</h2>
<ul>
<li>Takkyūbin (宅急便) or ta-q-bin = door-to-door luggage delivery.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why use it</h2>
<ul>
<li>Skip hauling suitcases through stations, crowds, stairs, and bus transfers.</li>
<li>Perfect for multi-city runs (e.g., Osaka → Kyoto → Nikko) with day stops in between.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it works (quick steps)</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pack &amp; label your suitcase. Keep meds and valuables with you.</li>
<li>Arrange shipping at your hotel front desk or a counter at airports and major stations (look for Yamato/“Kuroneko,” JAL ABC, Sagawa).</li>
<li>Fill the slip (destination hotel name, address, phone; your name; desired delivery date).</li>
<li>Choose timing: standard is next-day (1 day) or two-day depending on distance and cutoff time.</li>
<li>Pay at the counter (cash or card; price depends on size and distance—typically modest vs. a taxi).</li>
<li>Travel light with a 1–2-day overnight kit while your main bag flies ahead.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pro tip for multi-stops (your case)</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you plan to pause in a city en route, ship your big bag two days ahead to the final hotel, and carry a small overnight bag for the intermediary stop(s). You stay nimble and skip station lockers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hotel vs. station delivery</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hotel → Hotel:</strong> Easiest. Most hotels happily send and receive; they’ll hold bags until check-in.</li>
<li><strong>Hotel ↔︎ Station counter:</strong> Useful if you want pickup near trains. Confirm counter hours; bring the claim slip to collect.</li>
<li><strong>Airport ↔︎ Hotel/Station:</strong> Common on arrival and departure days.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cut-offs &amp; timing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Send before late morning for best chance at next-day delivery; otherwise expect plus one day.</li>
<li>Rural areas may take an extra day.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you’ll need</h2>
<ul>
<li>Destination hotel name, address, phone (in Japanese if you have it—front desks will help).</li>
<li>Your name (matching the hotel booking).</li>
<li>Contact number (a mobile works).</li>
<li>ID isn’t usually required to ship; pickup at some station or airport counters may ask to see the shipping receipt (keep it!) and occasionally ID.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Packing &amp; labeling</h2>
<ul>
<li>Put your name plus check-in date on the bag tag.</li>
<li>Don’t ship passports, cash, laptops, or fragile items.</li>
<li>Use a hard tag or tape a paper tag under clear tape so it won’t tear off.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical costs (ballpark)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Similar to a short taxi ride, varying by size and distance. One large suitcase is usually reasonable; golf or ski bags cost a bit more.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Language help</h2>
<ul>
<li>Say: “Takkyūbin onegaishimasu” (I’d like luggage delivery, please).</li>
<li>Most counters and hotels have bilingual forms; staff can fill them out if you show your booking.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want, tell me your exact hops and dates (e.g., “Oct 2–4 Osaka, Oct 5–8 Kyoto, Oct 9 Nikko”), and I’ll map out when and where to hand off bags plus the exact counters to use at your stations and hotels.</p>
