<h2>What is a Danjiri Festival?</h2>

<p>Danjiri festivals are high-energy autumn celebrations featuring massive wooden carts carved to resemble miniature shrines or temples. These festivals are unique to the Kinki region around Osaka Bay and are famous for being thrilling, dangerous, and spectacular.</p>

<p><strong>The Danjiri floats at Otori Taisha:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Construction:</strong> Made from zelkova wood with intricate carvings depicting historical scenes, mythological figures, flowers, and sacred animals</li>
<li><strong>Size and Weight:</strong> Approximately 4 meters tall and weighing over 4 tons each</li>
<li><strong>Pulling Teams:</strong> 400-1,000 men per float pull thick ropes while chanting "Sorya, sorya!"</li>
<li><strong>Roof Performers:</strong> The daiku-gata (carpenter) stands on top performing elegant fan dances while controlling direction</li>
<li><strong>Musicians:</strong> Taiko drummers, flute players, and bell ringers ride inside the cart creating the distinctive danjiri rhythm</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight">
<strong>Yarimawashi - The Thrilling Turn</strong><br>
The highlight of any danjiri festival is the yarimawashi‚Äîa maneuver where the massive 4-ton cart negotiates a 90-degree turn at full speed without slowing down. This requires perfect teamwork, timing, and considerable courage. It's both spectacular and one of Japan's most dangerous festivals, with participants risking injury from the unpredictable movements of these heavy floats.

<h2>About Otori Taisha Shrine</h2>

<p>Otori Taisha holds the prestigious position as the highest-ranked shrine of the former Izumi Province, making it one of the most important Shinto sites in southwestern Osaka. The shrine has a legendary history dating back approximately 1,900 years.</p>

<h3>The Legend of the White Bird</h3>

<p>According to ancient Japanese chronicles (the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki), the legendary hero Yamato Takeru no Mikoto died after offending the deity of Mount Ibuki during his conquests in eastern Japan. After his burial in Ise Province, his spirit transformed into a white heron (or bird) that flew westward. The place where this sacred white bird finally descended is said to be where Otori Taisha was founded. Legend claims that to prevent the bird from flying away again, trees grew thick overnight‚Äîwhich is why the shrine remains surrounded by an ancient forest today.</p>

<h3>Architectural Heritage</h3>

<p>The current shrine buildings were reconstructed between 1905 and 1909 after the original main hall was destroyed by fire. In March 2025, the main hall and worship hall were designated as Tangible Cultural Properties of Sakai City‚Äîrecognition of their architectural and historical significance.</p>

<p><strong>Notable architectural features:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unique blend of styles:</strong> Combines ancient Shinto shrine architecture with Meiji-era (1868-1912) innovation, reflecting Japan's modernization period</li>
<li><strong>Rare octagonal torii gate:</strong> An unusual feature standing before the worship hall</li>
<li><strong>600-year-old camphor tree:</strong> Located east of the main hall, a living witness to centuries of history</li>
<li><strong>Forested grounds:</strong> The shrine is enveloped by a lush, ancient forest creating a peaceful sanctuary</li>
</ul>

<h3>Historical Significance</h3>

<p>Otori Taisha weathered many storms throughout Japanese history:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sengoku Period (1467-1615):</strong> The shrine's estates (valued at 1,300 koku) were confiscated by warlord Oda Nobunaga in 1575 and the shrine was burned down</li>
<li><strong>1602 Reconstruction:</strong> Rebuilt by order of Toyotomi Hideyori, son of the great unifier Toyotomi Hideyoshi</li>
<li><strong>1615 Siege of Osaka:</strong> Destroyed again during the final battle between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa clans</li>
<li><strong>1662 Restoration:</strong> Reconstructed by the Tokugawa shogunate through the Sakai magistrate</li>
<li><strong>Meiji Restoration (1868):</strong> When Shinto and Buddhism were forcibly separated, the shrine reemerged as a purely Shinto institution</li>
</ul>
