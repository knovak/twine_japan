<strong>Why Visit Sakai?</strong><br>
UNESCO World Heritage site featuring the world's largest ancient tomb, birthplace of tea ceremony culture, renowned knife-making tradition, and authentic Japanese craftsmanship‚Äîall just 10 minutes from Kansai Airport.
</div>

<h2>Introduction to Sakai</h2>

<p>Sakai is a historic port city located just south of Osaka, with over 1,600 years of fascinating history. During the 16th century, Sakai flourished as an autonomous merchant republic and international trading hub, welcoming Portuguese traders who brought guns and bicycles to Japan. Today, Sakai preserves this rich heritage while remaining surprisingly off the tourist radar‚Äîmaking it a perfect destination for travelers seeking authentic Japanese culture without crowds.</p>

<p>The city is famous for three main things: the <strong>Mozu-Furuichi Kofun Group</strong> (ancient keyhole-shaped burial mounds designated as UNESCO World Heritage in 2019), <strong>Sakai knives</strong> (used by 90% of professional sushi chefs worldwide), and <strong>tea ceremony culture</strong> (birthplace of Sen no Rikyu, who perfected the Japanese tea ceremony).</p>

<h2>Why Sakai is Special</h2>

This gives you the rare opportunity to experience authentic Japanese history, craftsmanship, and culture without crowds or tourist prices. The combination of ancient history (world's largest tomb), living traditions (knife-making and tea ceremony), and easy accessibility from Kansai Airport makes Sakai an ideal addition to any Kansai itinerary.</p>

<p>The city's transformation from medieval trading port to modern industrial center, while preserving its cultural heritage, offers fascinating insights into how Japan balances tradition with progress.</p>
